Hello, my name is Rahul Naidu , and I am an enthusiastic undergraduate student currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Cybersecurity at Guru Nanak Institute of Technology. I have a strong passion for technology, particularly in the areas of network security, ethical hacking, and incident response.

I am proficient in C, Python, SQL, and DBMS, along with hands-on experience in Kali Linux, Windows security configurations, and firewall implementations. I have also completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, which strengthened my knowledge in network security, threat detection, and risk management.

In terms of practical experience, I have worked on projects like:
â€¢	Online Testing and Monitoring of Quality of Medicines (using Machine Learning and IoT).
â€¢	Student Management System using Python.
â€¢	WiFi Password Brute Force Attack using ng-crack.
â€¢	Configuring Firewalls using Splunk.

Beyond academics, I have taken leadership roles as the Vice President of the Cyberhawks Club at GNIT, where I organized workshops and seminars on cybersecurity awareness. Additionally, I contributed to Brumous Event 2024 as a Student Coordinator and volunteered in an NSS Medical Camp.
I am a quick learner, a team player, and a problem solver, always eager to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the field of cybersecurity. I am currently seeking an entry-level position where I can apply my skills to safeguard systems and data while continuously learning and growing.
Looking forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities in the tech industry! ðŸš€
